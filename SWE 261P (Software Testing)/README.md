# Introduction

This course exposed and taught me how to conduct a variety of software testing techniques. This includes functional testing, white box testing, combinatorial testing, Junit, mocking, TDD/BDD, continuous integration, testable design, and static analysis

# Goal: 

My team analyzed the Cryptomator application and developed new test cases to support their features. A final report was developed and added to this folder. The fork to the GitHub is located in my profile.
